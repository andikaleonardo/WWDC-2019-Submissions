Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency developed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Bitcoin is used as a digital payment system. Rather than use traditional currency. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.They all use an exciting technology called "Blockchain" that allows creating A purely peer-to-peer version of a decentralized network
Creation of Bitcoin addresses
In order to produce a Bitcoin address, a private key, which is a randomly selected number, is multiplied using an elliptic curve to produce a public key. This public key is then put through both the SHA-256 and RIPEMD160 hashing algorithms.
The goal of my Swift playground was to create a bitcoin Visualization that supported basic Blockchain operations. I wanted to show the power of Blockchain and how they work without getting too technical. Even though iOS has some built in Encryption and Blockchain libraries, I stayed away from them to prove it wasnâ€™t a black box or super complex. I also thought it would be cool if I just did it myself.
